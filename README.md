## Usage
To run a Google dork you have to create a file with a list of Dorks for the particular thing you are looking for and place it in the dorkfiles folder. I will be adding more lists over time.

Google will often block you if it detects automated queries so you may have to research a bit to avoid this

```python Pydorker.py <site> <dorklist>```
